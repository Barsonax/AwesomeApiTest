# How to contributie to TestExamplesDotnet

Everyone is welcome to contribute to TestExamplesDotnet. 

## How to contribute

- Fork the repository
- Modify the code
- Make sure the tests run before PR
- Create a pullrequest against the TestExamplesDotnet master branch

## Code quality

- There's a .editorconfig that holds the code style. Please use a IDE that supports this. Notably vscode needs an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) to make this work. Visual studio and Rider should work out of the box.
- Warnings have to be fixed before merging. Sometimes warnings might not be relevant and in that case they might be ignored but do discus this.
