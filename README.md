# AwesomeApiTest
This repository gives a example on how one can setup very fast and easy to run api tests that start to feel more like unit tests.

## How to use
I decided not to turn this into a nuget package for now. Depending on if you are using nunit or xunit copy the code that you need to your project, its not that much.

## Examples
Some examples can be found in [Examples](Examples)
